##2. What did you learn during the Githib lessons:
During those classes, I learned how to create and manage branches for different features, which allowed me to work on individual tasks without disrupting the main codebase. I also practiced writing structured and meaningful commit messages, helping me keep track of changes and maintain a clear development history. In addition, I gained valuable experience in opening and managing pull requests to propose changes and collaborate effectively. One of the most important skills I developed was resolving merge conflictsâ€”a crucial part of teamwork that ensures contributions from different sources are integrated smoothly into the project.
